Generate a Mandelbrot Set with Numpy

Generate a Mandelbrot Set with Numpy, using masking and indexing instead of the typical slow for loops. This only uses one for-loop for what it's generally intended for, to call bigger functions. Progress is displayed using tqdm. No bloated Cython required, just about 30 lines of code.
